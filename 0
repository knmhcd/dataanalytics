Hi Emma,

How are you? I never asked, but how is your sleep? You always go to bed so late (for me). Haha. What do you do all night?

I'm sorry for not responding earlier. I still feel exhausted from work, but that's not the only reason I didn't write. I had many thoughts on my mind about what you asked, and they weren't pleasant. I was traumatized by some experiences and haven't forgiven certain people, and at this moment, I don't want to. Your questions, which I feel confronted me more or less indirectly, brought up a lot of unresolved memories.

I think your questions also stem from bad experiences you had with someone close to you. For me, these experiences involved "friends" who became my business partners in my startup. I've made peace with most people, but a few I still can't forgive. For instance: One former friend, who was psychologically ill, struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts and couldn't keep a job. Due to his intelligence and creativity, I thought he might be a good fit for the team and would be grateful for the opportunity. However, it didn't work out. He was unreliable, couldn't handle criticism, and often felt like his world was crashing. At one point, he threatened suicide in front of the team because I told him his brain was like a sieve. I found this comment rather funny, but to him it meant humiliation. He was unorganized and forgetful, often missing customer appointments.

Working with him was deeply traumatizing and was one of the main reasons the startup failed. I cannot forgive him because I saw no willingness to work on himself or grow; instead, he played the victim. I cannot forgive someone who plays the victim, if that makes sense?

So, I hop this answers many of your questions. I cannot take him seriously, and this is why I believe an adult like him might not want to take the hand that the inner child might offer. This requires insight, reflection, and the will to confront oneself. I agree that there are people who are not ready or able to change. But why wait for them to change, if you can't talk openly to them about it? Did you talk to this person? I think yes... maybe you will tell me about the layers of your conversation one day.

It depends on the relationship with the other person. If they are important to you, it's crucial to talk to them. I want others to do the same with me because only then do I feel taken seriously. Giving others the benefit of the doubt and expecting change is futile if you can't have an open conversation.

You also asked:
Why do people come back and try to repair mistakes that stem from deep within their personality?
Why donâ€™t they work on themselves?
Why do they try to fix something that cannot be fixed?
I think these questions are interconnected. Changing habits or a familiar environment is hard, regardless of whether it's harmful. Once we are used to something, we tend to return to what we know. We associate with what is familiar, not necessarily what is best for us.

My mantra is:

You are what you think.
What you think is what you signal.
What you signal is what you attract.
Changing your thinking requires confronting and addressing issues. It demands new forms of responsibility, which can be scary, especially when it means stepping into the unknown. Many people avoid such situations out of fear. This is why we avoid unpleasant tasks like talking to customers, opening court letters or doing taxes, and why we hesitate to address others' behavior (my big mistake). Confrontation means being honest with ourselves and accepting potentially negative feedback. So, why do we return to broken relationships? Because we haven't fixed our own broken relationships and follow familiar patterns - it's a quick fix and the easy way out. Change is hard because it's work and it's scary.

However, it's interesting that the world around us remains unchanged if we confront ourselves, but we have the opportunity to grow smarter by confronting ourselves. A crisis, though difficult, is not always bad. It signals that a change is about to happen, and within every crisis lies an opportunity for personal growth.

As I told you before when you felt down and empty, this is the moment to refuse to succumb and show people that you are a force. I meant it then, and I live by it now.

Take care,

Korbinian
